To deploy the template you need the registration token of the host pool you want to add the virtual machine.

To obtain the registration token, you need the *Windows Virtual Desktop Cmdlets for Windows PowerShell*.
This [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/windows-virtual-desktop/overview) has the instrunction on how to download and import the modulre.

Once you have imported the *Windows Virtual Desktop Cmdlets for Windows PowerShell*, you need to sign in to WVD.

```powershell
Add-RdsAccount -DeploymentUrl https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com
```

Now, you generate a registration token that is used to join virtual machiens to the wvd host pool:
```powershell
New-RdsRegistrationInfo -TenantName <tenantname> -HostPoolName <hostpoolname> -ExpirationHours <number of hours>
```

You can obtain th token by running the follwong command:
```powershell
(Export-RdsRegistrationInfo -TenantName <tenantname> -HostPoolName <hostpoolname>).Token
